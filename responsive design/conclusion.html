                <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                 <p>Only the 5%  and 10% NiO sorbent has been tested, so conclusions about the effect of NiO on adsorption cannot yet be made. Although, based on the current data, it seems that the addition of NiO to AC does not significantly increase or decrease adsorption. Later data is necessary to draw more substantial conclusions.

                  <h3>Implications</h3>
                  <ul>
              <li> Could lead to innovations that support public health</li>
              <li>Could replace less eco-friendly filtration methods</li>
              <li>Less biomass will be sent directly to landfills</li>
              <li>Could lower rate of deforestation</li>
              <li>Could leave more trees standing to absorb atmospheric CO2</li>
              <li>Less biomass will be sent directly to combustion facilities</li>
              <li>Could lower lowering emissions of CO2 and societal carbon footprint
</li>
            </ul>

           <h3>Future Research</h3>
           <p>Repeat results of current study for validation
Test alternative ratios of AC and NiO
Needed to determine optimal ratio for sorbent performance
Design and test filter that uses AC-NiO sorbent to remove phenol from water
Contingent upon future research indicating that NiO improves sorbent performance
Investigate sorbent performance on other common water contaminants
