                <h3>Results</h3>
                 <p>Data was collected on the final phenol concentrations of the phenolic solutions. The final phenol concentrations were subtracted from the initial phenol concentrations in order to determine how much phenol was adsorbed by the sorbent material. That value was referred to as the adsorption capacity, which described the milligrams (mg) of phenol that could be adsorbed by a gram (g) of the sorbent material. Data on the adsorption capacity of the various sorbent compositions is shown below in Table 1 and Figure 1. Note that the percentages presented in the left column are based on mass, and “AC” and “NiO” refer to activated carbon and nickel oxide, respectively.

                  The statistical significance of the above results was determined using calculations of the standard error of the mean. These calculations revealed whether or not there were significant differences in the adsorption capacities of the different sorbent compositions, as shown in Table 2. Any overlap in the ranges presented in the right column of the table indicates that there was not a significant difference between the adsorption capacities of overlapping groups. The results remained consistent throughout the three different sorbent compositions, and no outliers were identified.
