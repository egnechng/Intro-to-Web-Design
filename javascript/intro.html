                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                 <p>Phenol is a highly toxic aromatic compound frequently released into the environment via various anthropogenic sources. Activated carbon and Nickel (II) oxide have both been shown to be effective phenol adsorbents. AC is also a very sustainable material, as it can be sourced from biomass like food waste, making it a desirable sorbent. This project aimed to utilize food-derived AC combined with NiO to detoxify phenolic water. The mentor conducted batch experiments by placing the AC/NiO sorbent into phenolic solutions of varying concentrations over varying periods of time. These experiments yielded data about the capacity and adsorption rate of the sorbent. The students used this data to create thermodynamic and kinetic models of the tested adsorption process. These models were then employed to propose the design of an AC/NiO-based filter for removing phenol from water. Findings thus far have been inconclusive. The findings of this project may lead to innovations that more effectively purify water and, therefore, support public health. Additionally, by utilizing biomass in a sustainable manner, less will need to be placed in landfills, thereby lowering the demand for deforestation and excavation. Decreased environmental damage will, in turn, leave more trees standing to absorb atmospheric carbon and lessen the global greenhouse effect.

          	<h3>Background</h3>
          	<ul>
          		<li>Adsorption: the adhesion of one substance (the adsorbate) onto the surface of another substance (the adsorbent)</li>
          		<li>Phenol: highly toxic aromatic compound commonly used in manufacturing frequently released into environment via anthropogenic wastewater (Yadav 2019)</li>
          		<li>Activated carbon: form of carbon processed to have small pores and high SA created by heating and chemically impregnating carbonaceous material (Kosheleva)</li>
          		<li>Highly effective sorbent material (Wang 2019)</li>
				<li>Nickel (II) Oxide: Dark greenish powder used in many electrical applications </li>
				<li>Shown to be an effective phenol adsorbent (Dehmani 2020)</li>
          	</ul>
          	<h3>Problem & Purpose</h3>
          	<ul>
          		<li> Phenolic water poses a threat to public health.</li>
          		<li> Food waste is discarded before its use is maximized.</li>
          		<li> This project aims to create an effective, eco-friendly phenol adsorbent using nickel oxide and food-derived activated carbon, addressing both issues.</li>
          	</ul>

            <h3>Methods</h3>
            <h4>Sorbent Creation</h4>
           <ul>
          		<li> Grind up discarded biomass 
Biomass then repeatedly washed and dried 
</li>
          		<li> Biomass is vigorously heated in a furnace 
yields powdery char of mainly carbon </li>
          		<li> Biochar steamed to widen pores of carbon granules
Biochar is now AC</li>
				<li>NiO powder added to AC to produce desired sorbent</li>
          	</ul>
            <h4>Sorbent Testing</h4>
            <ul>
          		<li>Phenol solution conc. to 100 mg/L</li>
          		<li>3 beakers filled with 50 mL of phenol solution </li>
          		<li>Sorbent added to beakers until sorbent conc. is 1 g/L </li>
          		<li>Solutions left and stirred for 24 hours. </li>
          		<li>Sorbent material filtered out of each solution </li>
          		<li>Remaining solution put under UV spectroscopy to determine the final phenol concentration. </li>
          	</ul>
