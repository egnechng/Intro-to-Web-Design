	<h1>Research Experience</h1>
	<p>During high school, I was very involved in conducting scientific research through my school's Science Research Program. During my sophomore year, I conducted research on smartphone addiction, a very serious problem among our youth. </p>

	<p>During my junior and senior years, I worked with <a href="https://www.newhaven.edu/faculty-staff-profiles/chong-qiu.php">Dr. Chong Qiu</a> from the University of New Haven to do modelling research on the atmosphere. Specifically, I investigated the effect of alkylamines on the properties of sea salt aerosols, which is a very important topic when it comes to the atmosphere and climate change. Recently, we submitted the research paper for publication to the Journal of Emerging Investigators. A few weeks ago, we submitted our final revisions, so we are almost at the point of publication.</p>
	<p>At NYU, I hope to be involved in research as well. Currently, I am interested in Natural Language Processing at Courant. As I become more knowledgable in the field of computer science and linguistics, I aim to pursue research in this field in the near future.</p>
