		<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hello, my name is Eugene Chang. I am a first-year NYU student studying Computer Science at CAS. I was born in Iowa, but I have lived in New Haven, Connecticut for most of my life where I attended and graduated from <a href="https://www.amityregion5.org/">Amity High School.</a></p>
