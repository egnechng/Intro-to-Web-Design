I decided to focus my website on men's mental health because it is often overlooked by society.
I understand than many men struggling with mental health suffer in silence because there is a stigma on men's mental health.
Many man tend to bottle up their emotions instead of opening up and reaching out for help. 
Therefore, many people struggling with these issues do not recieve the care they need and many end up resorting to suicide.
My website will discuss the facts about mens's mental health and suicide, contain information on how to seek help, and ways to learn more.
My home page will overview mental health with statistics, graphs and other forms of visual media.
My second page will contain information on how to seek help.
The third page will contain information on how to learn more about men's mental health and how the reader can contribute to the cause.
My goal for this website is to raise awareness on men's mental health and to fight the stigma on seeking help.
Hopefully, the information on my website can help at least one person in need.
