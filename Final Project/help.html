                <h2>Talk to a Doctor</h2>
                <p>Visiting a healthcare professional can be a good start.
                    They can refer you to a psychiatrist or psychologist. <br>

                <h2>Open up to friends</h2>
                <p>Taking to your friends about what you are going through can be a huge help.
                    Doctors recommend finding someone that you can speak openly with about your emotions.<br>
                    While seeing a therapist or doctor can help, opening up to friends is also a good way to improve your mental state.
                    Likewise, make yourself available to a friend in need by opening up conversations to discuss each others emotions.
