                <h2>Types of mental health conditions</h2>

                    <li>Depression</li>
                    <li>Anxiety disorers</li>
                    <li>Obsessive-compulsive disorder</li>
                    <li>PTSD: post-traumatic stress disorder</li>
                    <li>Schizophrenia</li>
                    <li>Bipolar disorder</li>
                  
               </ul>
                <h2>Men are affected by mental health too</h2>
                <p>
                    It is a common misconception that men are less likely to have mental health conditions, like depression.
                    In fact, in 2019, men died of suicide at a rate 3.7 times higher than that of women.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though biological factors can play a role, the cause for this huge disparaity is gender stereotypes, coping mechanisms, among other assumptions about who 
                    experiences mental health conditions.
                </p>

                <h2>Why men are less likely to reach out</h2>
                <p>
                    According to the National Institute of Mental Health, men are less likely to recieve mental health treatment than women.
                    Men can find it difficult to be open about their mental health and seeking help because of cultural stereotypes around how men should act,
                    such as "appearing strong".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, those who do not speak about their feelings might have difficulty recognizing symptoms of mental health issues.
